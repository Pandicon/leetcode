# LeetCode

This repository is a collection of my [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions.

## What can you find here?

You can find all of my LeetCode problems' solutions. They are separated into the [daily](https://github.com/Pandicon/leetcode/tree/main/daily) and [problems](https://github.com/Pandicon/leetcode/tree/main/problems) folders. The problems folder is further separated into [algorithms](https://github.com/Pandicon/leetcode/tree/main/problems/algorithms) and [concurrency](https://github.com/Pandicon/leetcode/tree/main/problems/concurrency).

The daily folder only includes the solutions I came up while the problem was set as daily, you will also find the solutions in the problems folder, but there will be all the ones I found.

Each problem will have a description provided by LeetCode, a link to the problem on the website, and also my approaches with the performance they got.
